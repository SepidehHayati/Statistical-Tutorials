# Statistics

## Introduction to Statistics 
This repository contains my drafts, practice notes, and tutorial sheets for reviewing and understanding key concepts in statistics. These notes are a work in progress and are meant to help me (and hopefully others) solidify foundational concepts in statistics.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) tools:

### 1. Moments in Statistics
  - Mean (Mode, Median, Trimmed_Mean)
  - Variance (Standard deviation, Coefficient of Variance)
  - Skewness
  - Kurtosis
### 2. Data Distribution
  - Histogram
  - BoxPlot
