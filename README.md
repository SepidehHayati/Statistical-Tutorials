# Introduction to Statistics

This repository contains my drafts, practice notes, and tutorial sheets for reviewing and understanding key concepts in statistics. These notes are a work in progress and are meant to help me (and hopefully others) solidify foundational concepts in statistics.
The content is based on online educational courses and university programs I have completed.

## Types of Statistics
Statistics is broadly divided into two main types:

#### **1. Descriptive Statistics**
`Descriptive statistics` are used to summarize, organize, and describe the main features of a dataset. They are often used for EDA to focus on presenting data clearly and understandably through measures.
The goal is to provide an overall summary of the data without making predictions or inferences about the population.

#### **2. Inferential Statistics**
`Inferential statistics` use sample data to make generalizations, predictions, or inferences about a larger population. This involves hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis, and other statistical tests to conclude the observed data.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Type of Analysis:
#### **1. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) **
belongs under `Descriptive Statistics`, which focuses on summarizing and exploring the data (e.g., mean, median, variance, and visualizations like Q-Q plots).
#### **2. HT (Hypothesis Testing)** 
falls under `Inferential Statistics`, as it involves testing assumptions about the population (e.g., normality tests, comparisons like K-S and KLD).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## General Comparison & Overlap

#### **EDA vs. HT:**
- `EDA` often sets the foundation by summarizing and exploring the data.
- `HT` builds on EDA by using statistical tests to confirm or reject assumptions.

#### **Descriptive vs. Inferential:**
- `Descriptive` Summarizes, organizes, and describes the main features of a dataset without concluding the population.
- `Inferential` Uses sample data to make generalizations, predictions, or conclusions about a larger population. Includes hypothesis testing and statistical modeling.

## 1. General Concepts
These are the foundational concepts and methods used across both Descriptive and Inferential Statistics.

  
#### Moments:
1. Mean (Central Tendency): Median, Mode, Trimmed Mean
2. Variance (Dispersion): Standard Deviation, Coefficient of Variation
3. Skewness
4. Kurtosis

#### Five-Number Summary
1. Min
2. Q1
3. Median
4. Q3
5. Max

#### Distributions
1. Normal (Gaussian)
2. Uniform
3. Bernoulli (Failure/Success)
4. Binomial
5. Multinomial

#### Statistical Comparison Metrics
1. Q-Q Plot
2. Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD)
3. Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) Test
4. Shapiro Test

## 2. Specific Concepts
These are methods and tools specifically tied to EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) or HT (Hypothesis Testing):

#### Sampling Methods
  - Simple Random Sampling
  - Systematic Sampling
  - Stratified Sampling
  - Cluster Sampling
#### Sample Size
  - 10 %
  - Confidence Level, Confidence Interval
  - subtopic3
#### Data Types
  - Numerical: Continuous, Discrete
  - Categorical: Nominal, Ordinal
