## Introduction to Statistics

This repository contains my drafts, practice notes, and tutorial sheets for reviewing and understanding key concepts in statistics. These notes are a work in progress and are meant to help me (and hopefully others) solidify foundational concepts in statistics.
The content is based on online educational courses and university programs I have completed.

## Statistics Overview

Statistics is broadly divided into two main types:

#### **1. Descriptive Statistics**
`Descriptive statistics` are used to summarize, organize, and describe the main features of a dataset. They are often used for EDA to focus on presenting data clearly and understandably through measures.
The goal is to provide an overall summary of the data without making predictions or inferences about the population.

#### **2. Inferential Statistics**
`Inferential statistics` use sample data to make generalizations, predictions, or inferences about a larger population. This involves hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis, and other statistical tests to conclude the observed data.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type of Analysis:
#### 1. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) 
belongs under `Descriptive Statistics`, which focuses on summarizing and exploring the data (e.g., mean, median, variance, and visualizations like Q-Q plots).
#### 2. HT (Hypothesis Testing) 
falls under `Inferential Statistics`, as it involves testing assumptions about the population (e.g., normality tests, comparisons like K-S and KLD).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### General Comparison & Overlap

#### EDA vs. HT:
- `EDA` often sets the foundation by summarizing and exploring the data.
- `HT` builds on EDA by using statistical tests to confirm or reject assumptions.

#### Descriptive vs. Inferential:
- Some tools (e.g., Q-Q Plot) and concepts (e.g., confidence intervals) serve descriptive and inferential purposes depending on their use case.

## 1. Descriptive statistics: 
  - Measures of Central Tendency
    - Mean (Mode, Median, Trimmed Mean)
  - Measures of Dispersion (Variance: Standard Deviation, Coefficient of Variance)
  - Moments (Skewness, Kurtosis)
  - Five-Number Summary (Min, Q1, Median, Q3, Max)

## 2. Inferential Statistics
