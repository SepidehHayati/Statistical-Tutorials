# Statistics

Introduction to Statistics ðŸ“Š
This repository contains my drafts, practice notes, and tutorial sheets for reviewing and understanding key concepts in statistics. These notes are a work in progress and are meant to help me (and hopefully others) solidify foundational concepts in statistics.

ðŸ“– Branches of Statistics
Descriptive Statistics: Summarizes data using measures like mean, median, and standard deviation.
Inferential Statistics: Makes predictions or tests hypotheses about a population based on sample data.

ðŸ“– Population and Sampling
Population: The entire group being studied.
Target Population: The group you aim to analyze.
Available Population: The part of the population accessible for sampling.
Sample: A subset of the population used for analysis.
Subject: An individual within the sample.

ðŸ“– Types of Analysis
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Examines data to find patterns or anomalies using visualizations and summary statistics.
Hypothesis Testing: Confirms or rejects assumptions using statistical methods.


ðŸ“– Variables
1. Numerical Variables
Data with meaningful mathematical operations (e.g., >, <, =).

Interval: No true zero point (e.g., temperature in Celsius).
Ratio: Has a true zero point (e.g., age, weight).
2. Categorical Variables
Data grouped into categories or labels.

Ordinal: Ordered categories (e.g., education levels: Bachelor, Master, PhD).
Nominal: Categories with no specific order (e.g., car brands: Toyota, Honda).

ðŸ“– Sampling Methods
Simple Random Sampling: Each member of the population has an equal chance of selection.
Systematic Sampling: Select every nth member from a list.
Stratified Sampling: Divide the population into subgroups (strata) and sample from each.
Cluster Sampling: Divide the population into clusters, then randomly select entire clusters for study.


ðŸ“– Sample Size
10% Rule: A typical sample size is 10% of the population.
Confidence Level: The likelihood that the sample accurately represents the population (e.g., 95%, 99%).
Confidence Interval: The margin of error (e.g., Â±5%).


ðŸ“– Moments of a Dataset
1. Measures of Central Tendency
Mean: The average of all values.
Median: The middle value in sorted data (less sensitive to outliers).
Mode: The most frequent value in the dataset.
Trimmed Mean: Removes a percentage of extreme values before calculating the mean.
2. Measures of Dispersion
Variance: How spread out the data is around the mean.
Standard Deviation: The square root of variance, showing the average distance from the mean.
